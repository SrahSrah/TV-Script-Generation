# TV-Script-Generation
Utilize TensorFlow and scripts from the Simpson's to create a recurrent neural network that can generate new scripts for scenes in Mo's Tavern.

## The Data
The data was made up of Simpon's scenes occuring exclusively in Mo's Tavern. Below is some data.

## Results
As we can see, the results are pretty non-sensical. However, there are some encouraging signs that the model presented here is beginning to learn the basic structure of a script scene. Most lines begin with a character name followed by a colon.
